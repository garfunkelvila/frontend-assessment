# Introduction
I used vue.js with nuxt.js as ssr

## Build Setup

```bash
# change directory to exam.mind-arc
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```
## Some notes
* I used Vuetify because I read the coding guidelines last. My bad.
* I always use `is` with booleans and may use `has` in the future.
* I'm not familiar with `BEM` syntax, I'll have a quick check on it later.
